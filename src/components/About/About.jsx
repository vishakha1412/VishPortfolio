                Hey! I'm currently in my second year of B.Tech, riding the highs and lows of the engineering hustle. Somewhere between 8 AM lectures and late-night code bugs, I’ve found myself drawn to the world of frontend development—especially building with React, Tailwind CSS, and APIs that make things actually feel alive. What started as curiosity has turned into a full-on creative quest: designing mood-based interfaces, experimenting with dashboard ideas, and piecing together projects that reflect who I am (and who I’m becoming). Still learning, still growing—and loving the process, even when it's messy.
