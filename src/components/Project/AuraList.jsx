                <p className='text-center object-fill'>AuraList is a digital canvas for tracking not just tasks, but the moods, moments, and memories that shape our day-to-day flow. Designed with vibrancy and intention, it transforms routine list-making into a personalized experience of emotional clarity and creative expression. Whether you're logging fleeting thoughts, mapping out goals, or curating your aura for the day, each entry becomes a snapshot of your inner world—color-coded, time-stamped, and open to reflection. Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS, the interface invites you to engage with your data intuitively: update, edit, or delete entries with ease, and create new ones at the tap of a button. AuraList isn't just about productivity—it's about presence. It's for dreamers, planners, artists, and analysts alike, offering a playful, inclusive space to record life’s rhythm in a way that’s both structured and soulful. Every title is a breadcrumb toward understanding what your day felt like—and why that matters.</p>
